## ❓Why this project ?
- Display Ad Campaigns are one of the most effective Ad Campaigns for those businesses who mainly  focuss on building brand awareness, increasing online visibility, and driving traffic to their website.
- As a part of my Google Ads Projects for portfolio I chose a leading E-Commerce Company dealing in Fashion Industry named Zalando. To understand how to drive sales on website how to create campaign tailoring to a Upcoming Summmer Sale. Therefore precise targetting, demographics & efficient Ad Copy is very relevant. As Display Ads Campaign have no specific keywords which means the Users do not arrive on your website or Ad intentionally after searching for something, they just stumble upon the Ad and choose to Shop.
- I learnt about Website Design, Landing page optimisation, Ad Copy creation tailoring to Summer Sales and Business, visuals specific for all Ad Hosting Platforms.
